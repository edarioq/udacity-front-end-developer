# Udacity FEND Arcade Game

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Project Rubric
----------------------------

### Error Free

The game functions correctly and runs error free

* Player can not move off screen
* Vehicles cross the screen
* Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
* Vehicle-player collision resets the game
* Something happens when player wins

### Object Oriented code

Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.

### Documentation

* A `README` file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.
* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.
* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.
