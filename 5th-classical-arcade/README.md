# Udacity FEND Arcade Game

Functions written are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and appropriate use of the keyword 'this' in classes and class prototype functions that refer to the object the function is called upon.

## [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric)

### Error Free

The game functions correctly and runs error free

* Player can not move off screen
* Vehicles cross the screen
* Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
* Vehicle-player collision resets the game
* Something happens when player wins

### Object Oriented code

Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.

### Documentation

* A `README` file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.
* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.
* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.

### Additional functionality to the game beyond minimum requirements, for example:

* Add collectible items on screen
* Multiple vehicle types
* Timed games
* Be creative!
