How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Less lines to read

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easier to fix bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Structured code history with commits having clear logical purpose
    Cons: Unstructured code history

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because a project can be made up of more than one file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To see file history and edit history and compare files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can make a branch and start working on a new feature all while
    having a point to back to just in case

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Keep a history of my work, make significant changes to code without worry,
    and easily share code base with other developers
