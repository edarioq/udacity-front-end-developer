When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share code, and to sync between different work stations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    A local machine might have a different branch (feature) I'm working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Github feature that remotely clones a repo to your account
    Clones: Duplicates a repo either locally or remotely
    Branch: A new version of the current branch (usually master) that can contain changes to code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Don't know... Maybe that you have a copy of things just in case, an extra security layer.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using email, maybe dropbox too
    Easier: Everyone knows how to use email and dropbox
    Harder: Speed at which things are done, reviewed, edited, and approved

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To work on a new feature, or fix a bug, the benefit is to have original code in tact just in case you want need to revert, you can also share the feature or bug fix with others and if everything is ok you can create a pull request for that branch to merge into master
