## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Part 1: Optimize index.html

Following are the steps I took to reach a pagespeed score of 90 or higher:

1. Inline all the CSS (in the head tag)
2. Moved all JS to the bottom of the page
2. Optimize all images with imagemagick
3. Removed the Google Font call in the head tag and instead called it via JS at the bottom of the page
4. Also added a cache control meta tag in the head, but I did not see much improvement...

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
