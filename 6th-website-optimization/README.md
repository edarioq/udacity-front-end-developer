# Part 1: Optimize index.html

##Following are the steps I took to reach a pagespeed score of 90 or higher:

1. Inline all the CSS (in the head tag)
2. Moved all JS to the bottom of the page
2. Optimize all images with imagemagick
3. Removed the Google Font call in the head tag and instead called it via JS at the bottom of the page
4. Also added a cache control meta tag in the head, but I did not see much improvement...### Part 1: Optimize index.html
